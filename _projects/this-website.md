# HI.

This is my first blog post ever.

## Motivation

I decided to do this to make myself productive and keep track of my development.

Another reason is in case I forget something that I learned long ago, I'll have all my thought process and mistakes documented. All these information might just as well help somebody in the same situation or teach about something new.

## Challenges

I'll try to write this in English to keep my brain challenged and out of my comfort zone. Lol. I just noticed 'comfort' is written with 'm'.  

I'll try to keep this updated and post interesting things.

## What I expect

Hopefully this will become a portfolio in a future time. I also just saw a [youtube video about overpopulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348) and got naively inspired to help humanity progress by disseminating knowledge, even if a little.  

I hope I'll become better at writing and developing my personal side along the way.

This post image is the *Stellated Dodecahedron* which is a geometric volume that is really pretty. It is used a lot by an artistic called **M.C. Escher** that I like.
