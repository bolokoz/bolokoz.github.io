# How is it made

This website uses Jekyll to structure all the content and folders. It uses a HTML template that I found and is hosted free with GitHub Pages.
Also uses Travis and I push modification to github it automatically builds it. 

## Jekyll

Jekyll is a ~framework~ that allow easy blog creation.
After the initial setup, all you have to do is write content.
You can use Markdown and it takes care of all folders, for loops and much more.
