# Yes, it's the third iteration.

## How it was created

I began developing Android apps when I first heard of numerical methods *back in 2012* in a class in my engineering course. Numerical methods was all about iterations and programming and I gave Java + Android a try. It was all for **learning and practicing**. That was NumericalAnalysis iteration 1. It was not a good app and was never released.

Later I was more familiar with Android starting to understand more advanced stuff. I came across the concept of **fragments** and tried to remake my old NumericalAnalysis using that. It was also not a good app.

Now, for the third edition, **MVC**. It's a programming concept where you separate things so they don't broke as often. It can get really complex and I didn't go through all the advanced models but, in short, you isolate the brains, the interface and the visuals of the program. It's what is called a *software design pattern* and I used the most basic pattern there is, [you can find the expert stuff here](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture).


## Usefulness and some background

Yeah, I don't think the app is very useful since numerical analysis is a thing you should do carefully - and when I say carefully I mean *not in a smartphone* - but who knows.

 Also, maybe someone can use it to cheat in a test. It's just stupid making students memorize numerical methods formulas nowadays. It's a kind of knowledge you have to always go look up a book, not from memory. In my case, **I failed my numerical methods** class even after making this app. I was understanding, like no one, the iterations and the nuances of each method that was required. Unfortunately I didn't memorize the *formulas of the error* of some methods and I had a 'no cheating philosophy' at that time. I failed and at that time I had applied to study in Netherlands and was denied to go just because of this fail...
