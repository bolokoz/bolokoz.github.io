# Interactive graphics using R and Shiny

## Real time, interactive visualizations

This Web App uses a framework called Shiny. It's used for interactive visualizations and they have a very cool gallery showing all the cool stuff you can make [here][67d95b33]. They offer an website where you can upload some of your projects to be accessible without setting up a server yourself **for free**, *limited to 5 projects*.

I made this in an attempt to learn using R for real life needs. All I had learn in the youtube tutorials were very dull and not practical. It just happened to be at the exact same time I was learning about train resistance *for the third time* in my course, so I took it a shot.

I found out that R is very newbie friendly, specially Shiny. Almost all I did when I had trouble was copying and pasting from the projects in the Shiny gallery.

At the end I tried using [Plot.ly for R](https://plot.ly) to make the graphics look even more cooler and I had some difficulty trying to figure it out. It eventually worked.
