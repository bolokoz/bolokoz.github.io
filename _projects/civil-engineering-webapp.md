# Civil Engineering WebApp

## How it was created

I stopped developing for Android because I believe web is the future.
I watched several different tutorials on web dev and, in the end, I picked [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
It's fairly simple and offers a lot. It's layout is made with [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) and you just grab elements and put all together to form the page.

## Why?

I just finished studying civil engineering for 5 years and I was annoyed by the fact I was doing nothing for the community, as I study in a public university.
