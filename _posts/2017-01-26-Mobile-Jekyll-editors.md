# Blogging is hard 

## but it can be easier if done anywhere you want 

That's why today's post is about online editor designed to Jekyll. 

So for I tested Prose.io and the Android app Mr.Hyde that I'm using right now. 

## Prose 
Prose looks well developed and is very sleek and fast. I just had some confusion the first time I tried it because the buttons had no labels and u couldn't figure out what they do. Sometimes clicking in a button results in nothing but I just learned to click on the buttons I know the reaction. 

## Mr. Hyde
The Android app Mr. Hyde looks very promising. I'm just found it in Google play and it has only 500 downloads. It looks well built but sometimes clicking the option bar on the top crashes the app. It connects to your git whatever account and clones the repo into your phone. It's crazy. * It even runs Jekyll serve on the device* so you can preview what's going to look like. That's insane. How did they do it? 
Another cool thing: it has a dedicated button to post or draft. When you click, it automatically puts the correct date into the filename. 


## Difficulties in posting using your phone 

I still find it hard to type even small codes (like markdown hyperlinks) and that's why I won't link to the websites for these two apps I just described. My English is not that great and these apps don't offer auto correct and maybe this text is full of typos and I didn't even noticed.
