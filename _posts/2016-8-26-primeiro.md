HI.

This is my first blog post ever.

I decided to do this to make myself productive and keep track of my development.

I'll also write it in English to keep my brain challenged and out of my comfort zone.

I just noticed 'comfort' is written with 'm'.  

I'll try to keep this updated.

Hopefully this will become a portfolio in some time.

I'll leave you with a *Stellated Dodecahedron*.
