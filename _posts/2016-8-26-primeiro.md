HI.
This is my first ever blog post.

I decided to do this to make myself productive and keep track of my development.
I'll also write it in English to keep my brain challenged and out of my comfort zone.
I just noticed 'comfort' is written with 'm'.  

I'll try to keep this updated.
Hopefully this will become a portfolio in some time.

Stay with an picture of an *Stellated Dodecahedron*.
