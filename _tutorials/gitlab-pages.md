# Static websites 

## Create and host a static webpage in GitLab

GitLab offers free private projects unlike GitHub.
You can create *user* pages, *group* pages and *project* pages.
Creating a is pretty straight foward and you can follow the instruction on [GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io/).

You fork a project you're familiar with (like Jekyll or simple HTML) and it's basically ready. If you choose something more sofisticated (like Nuxt, that uses Vue) you need to build it in the pipeline and follow further instructions present in the `README.MD`.
