Template is called Forty.

Made with jekyll + Travis

It's my first web dev project and I have no ideia what's going on. Never used ruby and sass before. I still don't know what travis really does besides telling what's wrong with the build and sending annoying emails when it fails. And I'll just put the build status here like the cool guys.

## To-do:

If you are passing by and knows how to do some of these things, I'll be grateful if you can help.

- Blog layout
  - Return to blog button above title
 
  - Try to make footer go up to the tiles like homepage
  - Tile image is too bright and text is hard to read


- Improvements taken from [bettermotherfuckingwebsite](bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com). The sass files from this template are so huge. I'm regretting not starting with a simpler design. I don't even know where to change the values.
  - Make 60-80 characters long lines. (max-width?)
  - Increase font size
  - Line height?
  - Less contrast
